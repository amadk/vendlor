              Vendlor.com has a &quot;Buyer Protection Program&quot; which seeks to assist buyers to ensure their purchase is protected against fraud by any sellers on the Site. If a buyer has purchased an item by way of any of the Vendlor SafePay processes and never received it or received an item worth significantly less in value compared to what was described by the seller, the buyer may seek protection under the Buyer Protection Program. The Buyer Protection Program involves reimbursement by Vendlor.com to the buyer of the value of the item only. To be eligible under the Buyer Protection Program a buyer needs to file a complaint with Vendlor.com within 48 hours of receiving (or not receiving) the relevant item. Vendlor.com will investigate the matter and if it has been determined (by Vendlor.com in its sole discretion) that the seller has intentionally defrauded the buyer in relation to the item for which Vendlor.com has reimbursed the buyer, Vendlor.com may limit, suspend or withdraw the seller&apos;s access to the Site and/or the seller&apos;s membership and Vendlor.com may charge the seller for Vendlor.com&apos;s costs in reimbursing the buyer and for any handling and shipping (in accordance with the Fees &amp; Credit Policy .

You acknowledge and agree that if any item returned to Vendlor.com by a buyer is illegal or otherwise unlawful that Vendlor.com may in its sole discretion destroy the item or take any other steps as it considers necessary. <br/>

            <li> <a name="19"></a> <strong>Bidding and Buying</strong><br/>
              All bids (under the &quot;auction&quot; format) (&quot;Bids&quot;) and all purchases (under the &quot;Buy It Now&quot; format) (&quot;Purchases&quot;) on the Site are a commitment by you to complete the purchase of the item on which you have placed the Bid or which you have purchased. If you are the highest bidder / purchaser for any item and your Bid / Purchase is accepted by the seller (&quot;Winning Buyer&quot;), you are obligated to complete the transaction with the seller. In order for you to qualify and be identified as the Winning Buyer of an auction, 
              the following priority parameters are applied by Vendlor.com:<br/>
              <ul>
                <li>Price: a higher price Bid always supersedes any lower price bids;</li>
                <li>Quantity: Between Bids of the same price, a Bid for a higher quantity shall supersede;</li>
                <li>Time: Between Bids of the same price and for the same quantity, the Bid which was placed first in point of time shall supersede other such Bids.</li>
              </ul>
              You acknowledge and agree that in the event that dual Winning Buyers are displayed on the Site for a single auction, the user who receives an email from the Site declaring them the Winning Buyer will be the only Winning Buyer for that auction. Vendlor.com&apos;s decision on the success or otherwise of a bid shall be final and binding. It reserves the right to reject or void bids, whether winning or not, that it deems not to have been made in good faith, or that are restricted or prohibited. <br/>
            
              As a Winning Buyer you may increase the amount or volume of your Bid or Purchase but you may not reduce the amount or volume of your Bid or Purchase or withdraw / cancel your Bid or Purchase. By bidding or purchasing an item you agree to be bound by the conditions of sale included by the seller in the item&apos;s description on the Site (so long as those conditions of sale are not in violation of this User Agreement or are not in compliance with applicable laws). A Winning buyer must contact the seller or initiate an order for the item within 48 hours of the relevant auction closing or of a successful Purchase. As a buyer on the Site we encourage you to post feedback on the seller after the auction is closed. In case of consumer goods generally available in retail stores, sellers on the Site may or may not specify the normal retail prices of items being sold. You are advised to independently verify the retail prices of such items if you so desire. <br/>
              
              You agree not to test the Site with false bids or purchases, nor to use a false name, other false personal information or use an unauthorised or known invalid credit card to Bid or Purchase. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies available to Vendlor.com under this User Agreement or at law, Vendlor.com may take such steps as it deems appropriate or necessary including taking legal action against users who intentionally enter erroneous, fictitious or fraudulent Bids or Purchases. Please be aware that even if you do not give Vendlor.com your real name, your web browser transmits a unique address to us, which can be used by law enforcement officials to identify you. </li>

              As a registered member of the Site, you may list item(s) for sale on the Site. You may only offer for sale or sell item(s) on the Site in compliance with applicable laws and you must be legally able to offer for sale or sell such items under applicable laws. Listings may only include text descriptions, graphics and pictures that describe your item for sale. All listed items must be listed in an appropriate category on the Site. Soliciting business offline or outside of the Site, by indicating your contact details (e.g. contact phone number, address or e-mail) in the item listing or elsewhere on the Site other than in your registration data is expressly prohibited and would constitute a breach of this User Agreement. All of your listed items must be kept in stock to allow for the immediate completion of your transaction with a Winning Buyer. The listing description of the item must not be misleading and must describe the actual current condition of the item. If the item description does not match the actual current condition of the item, you agree to refund any amounts in relation to that item that you may have received from the buyer. You agree not to list a single item multiple times for &quot;buy now&quot; sales, including without limitation across various categories on the Site. You acknowledge and agree that Vendlor.com has the right to delete such multiple listings of the same item. <br/>
              
              If you receive at least one bid at or above your stated minimum price (or in the case of reserve auctions, at or above the reserve price as defined by the seller in their reserve auction (the &quot;Reserve Price&quot;)), you are legally obligated to complete the sale with the Winning Buyer. You agree to contact or ship to the Winning Buyer within 48 hours of an item selling successfully and supply the item to the Winning Buyer in a merchantable condition within 48 hours of verifying payment by the Winning Buyer (if the payment is made through MyWallet) or confirming the order by the Winning Buyer (if payment is to be made through COD), unless the Winning Buyer fails to meet the terms of your listing (such as payment method), you cannot authenticate the Winning Buyer&apos;s identity by way of making direct contact with them, or as otherwise agreed between you and the Winning Buyer. Without limiting any rights or remedies available to Vendlor.com under this User Agreement or at law, Vendlor.com may suspend, limit or withdraw your access to the Site and/or your membership of the Site if you are found to have engaged in false or fraudulent activity in connection with the use of the Site. As sellers on the Site we encourage you to post feedback on each buyer after an auction is closed. An auction is successfully closed if it receives at least one bid prior to the date and time (as specified in that particular auction) beyond which no further bids are to be accepted (the &quot;Auction End Date&quot;). Notwithstanding this, a reserve auction is successfully closed if at least one bid above the Reserve Price is received prior to the Auction End Date. <br/>
          
              Immediately after an auction is successfully closed an e-mail is sent from the Site to both the Winning Buyer and the seller providing each of them with the contact information of the other party (including email address, shipping address and a contact phone number if allowed by them when bidding/purchasing or selling) to enable them to get in touch with each other for the sole purpose of fulfilling the transaction. Please note that the contact information that will be sent out will be the information that is provided by the users in their registration data on Vendlor.com. You acknowledge and agree that Vendlor.com has the right to use your registration data for this purpose and a that Vendlor.com is not responsible for the accuracy or otherwise of any user&apos;s registration data. You acknowledge and agree that you will not use another user&apos;s data for any purpose other than fulfilling a relevant transaction resulting from selling item(s) on the Site. </li>

              Vendlor.com encourages buyers and sellers on the Site to provide feedback on each other&apos;s conduct after a transaction has closed; as this helps all users know what it is like to deal with the said buyer/seller. Your feedback will be displayed along with your user ID on the Site. You cannot retract the feedback once you have left it. Vendlor.com will not be responsible or liable in any way for the feedback that you post on the Site. You agree not to make comments that are not factual in nature including without limitation making any racist comments, using profanity, abusing another user, disrespecting another culture or any other derogatory or inappropriate comments.

If you continuously receive negative feedback ratings, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of Vendlor.com under this User Agreement or at law, Vendlor.com reserves the right to suspend, limit or withdraw your access to the Site and/or your membership of the Site. <br/>
            
              You acknowledge and agree that your feedback consists of comments left by other users with whom you transact and a composite feedback number compiled by Vendlor.com, and that together these convey your full user profile.

Vendlor.com does not provide the technical ability to allow you to import feedback from other websites to the Site because a composite number, without the corresponding feedback does not reflect your true online reputation within our community. </li>
