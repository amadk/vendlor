      <span lang="EN"><strong>1</strong>.&#xA0;</span><b>Vendlor IPR Policy</b>. <span lang="EN">We take any violations of intellectual property rights seriously. We are committed to removing listing and selling of products or materials that infringe someone else&#x2019;s Intellectual Property Right (<b>IPR</b>). You may familiarize with our IPR policies, available at <a href="https://uae.Vendlor.com/ae-en/intellectual-property-rights/c/" target="_blank">https://uae.Vendlor.com/ae-en/<wbr/>intellectual-property-rights/<wbr/>c/</a></span><span lang="EN">. &#xA0;We may also report your activities and details to IPR owners, consumer affairs department and other law enforcement authorities.</span>

      <p>
      <strong>2</strong>.&#xA0;<b>Counterfeits or Refurbished Products.</b> Consumer trust is very important to us. It is a criminal offence to try to financially gain by using IPR &#xA0;without the owner&#x2019;s permission. Vendlor will remove your listing if we suspect your products are not genuine. Vendlor vigorously pursues sellers who sell counterfeit products. We work with Federal and local law enforcement officials to try to stop the sale of counterfeit products.
